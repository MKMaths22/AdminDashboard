Author notes by Peter Hawes:
---------------------------------------

For a change from previous Odin projects, I decided to go for accurate replication of the project design file, with my name substituted for Morgan Oakley. The project instructions directed me to the Material Design Icons but I found the Bigheads site myself --- I could have used the circular versions of those images but by the time I realised this I had already finished the header and didn't want to create inconsistencies.  

Also, it was only after I had decided to replicate the layout quite precisely that I noticed the variations in the project cards. The heights of the headers on the cards match across each row, and at first it was tricky to get things matching on separate grids. Then things got even trickier when I noticed that the three icons at the bottom of each card are slightly higher on the middle row.   

The fonts are very difficult to match precisely but I am quite satisfied with the results. I have been a little more relaxed with colour matching, except for the sidebar and header buttons, which have turned out beautifully (IMHO!)   

Although I spent a significant amount of time holding a pen against my monitor to compare the positions of things in the project design file and my version, I had several 'Eureka' moments in which by using DevTools to inspect the grids, I figured out how to increase/decrease gaps/padding etc. to make things move how I wanted. The target of matching the project design file kept me honest, forcing me to problem-solve instead of settling for something mediocre.
